## Chi-squared test for $2 \times 2$ tables

The test statistic for **Chi-squared test** for a $2 \times 2$ table is

$$\chi^2 = \sum_i \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}, \quad \text{d.f.} = 1$$
where $O_i, E_i$ is the **observed** and **expected values** in the $i_{th}$ cell.

For a $2 \times 2$ table, the test statistic is chi-squared distributed with 1 degree of freedom **under the null hypothesis**, of no association between the two variables.

This is equivalent to the z-test for the difference between two proportions.

A second formulation: 

$$\chi^2 = \frac{n \times (d_1 h_0 - d_0 h_1)^2}{d\times h \times n_1 n_0}, \quad \text{d.f.} = 1$$

## Fisher's Exact Test

When the numbers in the $2 \times 2$ table are very small, we need an exact test to compare the proportions. 

This is based on calculating the exact probabilities of the observed table, and of more extreme tables with the same row and column totals, using the following formula

$$\text{Exact probability} = \frac{d! \times h! \times n_1 ! \times n_0!}{n!\times d_1! \times d_0! \times h_1! \times h_0!}$$

with the standard notation for $2 \times 2$ table.

### P-value for the exact test

Approach I: 

P-val = probability of obbserved table + probability of less probable tabless

Approach II: 

P-val = $2 \times($ probability of observed table + probability of more extreme tables in the same direction$)$

## Chi-squared test for larger tables

Chi-squared test can also be applied to larger tables, which can be denoted as $r \times c$ tables. $r$ and $c$ are the number of rows and columns in the table. 

Test statistic: 

$$\chi^2 = \sum_i \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}, \quad \text{d.f.} = (r-1)\times (c-1)$$
which is chi-squared distributed with $(r-1)\times (c-1)$ degrees of freedom. For $2 \times 2$ tables, this reduces to 1 df. 

To compute the **expected** number, 

$$E = \frac{\text{column total} \times \text{row total}}{\text{overall total}}$$

The approximation of chi-squared test is valid when 

- less than 20% of the expected numbers are under 5, and 
- none of the expected numbers is less than 1.

Sometimes the restrictions can be overcome by combining rows (or columns) with low expected numbers, providing that these combinations make biological sense.



## Which test to choose

The two tests have different assumptions. 

**Chi-squared test** is valid when 

- the overall total is more than 40, regardless of the expected values; or, 
- the overall total is between 20 and 40, provided all the expected values are at least 5

**Exact test** is recommended when 

- the overall total is less than 20; or, 
- the overall total is betweenn 20 and 40, and the smallest of the four expected numbers is less than 5

The exact test can be very conservative - giving high p-values, and low power (i.e. fail to detect true effect)
