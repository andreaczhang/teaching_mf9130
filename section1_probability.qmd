## Basic concepts

Probability expresses a potential for something to happen. 

It corresponds to the concept of **risk** in medicine 

It is an assessment of **uncertainty** in a situation or event

### Brief history

**Blaise Pascal** (17th century): founder of probabiliy theory. Motivated by dice and card games

**Andrey Kolmogorov** (1933): formulated the rules



### Bayesian and frequentist probability

Bayesian definition: **Degree of belief** that some event will occur 


Frequentis definition: **Proportions of times** that some event occurred in a large number of similar repeated trials

#### Explain

Why there would be the two schools, key difference, and why we focus on frequentist
:::


### Law of Large Numbers

Frequency of an event is the proportion of times that the event does occur - interpreted as a probability 

LLN: As an experiment is repeated over and over, the observed frequency approaches the actual probability (true probability). Probability as limit of frequency

#### Explain

Check the example (Child birth)

How frequency is linked to LLN. 'True probability'

This is an example of a 'folded' caution callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use `collapse="true"` to collapse it by default or `collapse="false"` to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.

#### Example

Coin tossing

This is an example of a 'folded' caution callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use `collapse="true"` to collapse it by default or `collapse="false"` to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.

$$P(X = x) = \binom nx p^x (1-p)^{n-x}$$

## Probability calculation

### Events and sample space, stochastic trial

- (what is)
- uncertain oucome

All possible outcomes make up the sample space, where each outcome has a probability of occurrrence

The sum of all probabilities in the sample space equals 1

An event is a single outcome (or a collection of outcomes??)

### Venn diagram

Often used to illustrate events and sample space

![](figures/Figur3-1e.png)

A and B are events, S is the sample space

Operators on events 

- Union: $A \cup B$
- Intersection: $A \cap B$
- Combining operators: $A \cap \bar{B}$


### Calculation rules 

The probability of event A is denoted by $P(A)$. It is between 0 and 1

The probability over the whole sample space equals 1

**Complement rule**

$$P(A) + P(\bar{A}) = 1$$

**Additive rule**

The occurrence of at least one of the events A or B is
$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$$
For **disjunct** events A, B, $P(A \cap B) = 0$. Hence 
$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$$



**Multiplicative rule**

Probability of independent events can be multiplied

$$P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)$$
Examples: gender of the child in 2 births, throw of 2 dices

## Conditional probability

What is the probability of getting an outcome A given that it will at least occur in B? $P(A|B)$

Rescale the probability of events in B: such that the new sample space has probability 1, then 

$$\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$

::: {.callout-note}
#### Exercise

weather forecast
:::


### Stochastic independence

A and B are independent if 

$$P(A|B) = P(A)$$
Interpretation: probability of A is the same if we also know B occurs

::: {.callout-note collapse='true'}
#### Examples: independence

Consider the following: 

- A: Probability of I having the condition
- B: Probability of my partner having the same condition

Condition 1: diabetes, $P(A|B) = P(A)$

Condition 2: Covid19, $P(A|B) \neq P(A)$

Calculations can be simplified if there is stochastic independence
