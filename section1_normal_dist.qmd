## Normal distribution

Important distribution: 

- application 1
- application 2


Probability density function

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} exp(- \frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2})$$

- $\mu$ is the mean
- $\sigma$ is the standard deviation
- $exp(x) = e^{x}$

### Properties

- Symmetric, bell-shape
- $\mu$ and $\sigma$ define the location and variation 
- From the center (mean), going two standard deviations each way covers approximately 95% of the distribution

### Standard normal distribution 

A normal distribution $N(\mu, \sigma)$ with $\mu = 0, \sigma = 1$

Any normal disribution can be transformed into a standard normal distribution $N(0, 1)$: if $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma)$, then 

$$Y = \frac{X-\mu}{\sigma} \sim N(0, 1)$$

Standard normal distribution probabilities are commonly presented in tables, so people can check them easily.

## Normal approximation to the binomial distribution

Recall the binomial distribution, 

$$P(X = x) = \binom nx p^x (1-p)^{n-x}$$
where $\binom nx = \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}$, and $\binom n 0 = 1$

For large $n$, use the normal distribution.

### Normal vs binomial

Fit a normal distribution to approximate a binomial distribution

- $\mu = np$
- $\sigma = \sqrt{np(1-p)}$

### Central limit theorem CLT

CLT in simple words: the distribution of **sample mean** will be nearly normal regardless of what distribution the variable in the population is, as long as the sample size is large enough.

::: {.callout-important}
#### Explain

Point out that the observed proportion of boys can be considered as a mean

and the rule of thumb
:::

$$Binom(n, p) \rightarrow N(\mu, \sigma)\quad \text{for} \quad n \rightarrow \infty$$

if $np \geq 5$ and $n(1-p) \geq 5$
