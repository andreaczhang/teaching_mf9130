# Introduction to STATA

## Get started

Basic components of the user interface:

- **command window**: type in command to tell stata what to do
- **do-file editor**: write and execute `do-file` scripts
- **data editor**: makes it easy to edit and inspect data

When you **execute a command**, write the command in the command window, then **hit Enter**. 

For example, you can execute the command `use` to load data, and use `browse` to open up the data editor.

Data editor looks like this:

### File system: where things are

It is recommended to have different folders to stay organized. For example, you can have

- one folder for your **scripts** (such as `do-file`),
- one folder for **data** (for examplem, `csv`, `dta`, `xlsx`),
- one folder for **documentation**.


### Get help 

In the command, type `help *command_name*` to open up the documentation:

Alternatively, use Google. 


## Data entry, import and manipulation

Data format: `data.dta`


### Enter data manually 

Open the **data editor**, and type in data. This is equivalent to the commands in the command window, which you can see in the *Results* panel.

**Save** your data by clicking Save on the data editor. This is equivalent to the following command:

```
save "data/path/demo_data.dta"
```



### Import data 

Load (import) data by the command `use`, then specify the path of the data file. 

Write `browse` to view the data, or alternatively, click the data editor icon.

```
use "data/path/demo_data.dta"
```

### Basic manipulation 

Change variable names with `rename`

```
rename var1 name
rename var2 gender
rename var3 age
```

Add labels to variables, or change their properties with `label` command.

It is worth noting that stata recognize **double quote** `""`. Single quote will produce errors.

## Use `do files` 

`do files` are useful to save and document your analysis for the future. An example looks like this:

![](figures/stata_10_dofile.png)

To **run (execute)** a `do file`, write `do *filename.do*` in the command; alternatively, **hit Do** icon

```
do filename.do
```
You might need to use `clear` to remove data object before creating a new data.
